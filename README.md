# Web-Interface
This project automates the tasks of the convener. It uses the Django library (you will need to install it) to create a website project where students can upload queries and conveners can view and delete queries.

To run the application, open the webinterface folder in a terminal and run "python manage.py runserver". This will start the server.

You can then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/home where you will be taken to a log in page. To log in as a convener, both the username and password is admin. To see the student view, log in with the username Koketso and the password klkkok002. You will see a work-in-progress home page. As a convener, you can view requests by pressing "View Requests" to see a summary of all requests. As a student, you can click "Create New Request" where you can fill in a form and upload a file and finally submit a new query.
